DOM Manipulation
This set of prompts will guide you to create a Codename validator. This project will build up your knowledge of DOM Manipulation and give you experience of managing input from a user.

Set-up
Open a new StackBlitz project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Check everything is set up as you expect it - is your CSS linked in your HTML? Does your JavaScript file run?

Add an input box, a label, and a button to the HTML. Your input will be a string.

Functions
Write a function that checks the length of the string. The function should output true if the string is more than 5 characters long. Otherwise, return false.

Write a function that checks the string contains at least one lowercase letter; and at least one uppercase letter. If both are present, the function should return true - and if either are missing, it should return false.

Write a function which checks whether the string has at least two numbers in it. If it does, then return true and otherwise return false.

DOM Manipulation
Use DOM Manipulation to tie everything together.

Youâ€™ll need to check the value of the input when the user clicks the button. Verify the input gives true when given as an argument to each of the functions.

User experience
If all functions return true give visual feedback to the user that the codename is valid. If any function returns false then give the user feedback that the codename is not valid. How you implement this is up to you.
